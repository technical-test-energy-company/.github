# `[redacted]` company technical tests

This GitHub organization was created with the solely purpose of store and organize the technical tests being taken at the company `[redacted]`.

The goal here is organization and grouping of information for easier access to all parties involved in these tests, and not to share publicly any possible sensitive information about the `[redacted]` company or the `[redacted]` testee, which in this case is yours truly.

Given that there are two tests, one for frontend and one for backend, the environment will be set up so that they can be run either simultaneously or individually, while meeting the requirements in both cases.
